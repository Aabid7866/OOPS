It allows developers to model real-world entities as objects that contain both data (attributes) and behavior (methods). OOP promotes code reusability, modularity, and easier maintenance through its core principles: encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism."

Abstraction focuses on hiding the internal implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. It helps in reducing complexity. Encapsulation, on the other hand, is about restricting direct access to some of an objectâ€™s components by making variables private and providing public methods to access or modify them. While abstraction is concerned with what an object does, encapsulation is about how it does it."

        "-  Class methods and static methods are both methods that do not require access to instance-specific data. A class method is declared using the @classmethod decorator and takes cls as its first parameter, allowing access to class-level data. Static methods, defined with the @staticmethod decorator, do not take either self or cls and act like regular functions within a class, often used for utility operations related to the class but not dependent on class or instance data.\n",

        "**11. What is method overloading in Python?**\n",
        "-  Method overloading refers to defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. While traditional method overloading is not directly supported in Python, similar behavior can be achieved using default parameters, *args, or conditional logic inside a method to handle various cases. It helps increase the flexibility of functions and methods.\n",

        "**12. What is method overriding in OOP?**\n",

        "**13. What is a property decorator in Python?**\n",
        "-  The @property decorator in Python is used to define methods that behave like attributes. It allows you to access a method as if it were a variable. This is often used for implementing getters and allows encapsulated access to private data in a clean, readable way.\n",

        "**14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?**\n",

It also enables interface consistency and dynamic method binding during runtime.\n",

        "-  An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated and is designed to be a base class for other classes. It contains one or more abstract methods, which are methods declared but not implemented. Abstract classes are defined using the abc module and help enforce a consistent interface in subclasses.\n",

Overall, OOP helps in building complex applications in a structured and maintainable way.\n",

        "-  A class variable is shared by all instances of the class and is defined outside any methods. It is used when a value should be the same for all objects. An instance variable, on the other hand, is unique to each object and is usually defined within the constructor using self. Changes to an instance variable affect only that object, while changes to a class variable affect all instances.\n",

        "**18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?**\n",
        "-  Multiple inheritance is a feature in Python where a class can inherit from more than one parent class. This allows a subclass to combine behaviors and attributes of multiple base classes. However, it can also lead to complexity such as the diamond problem, which Python resolves using the Method Resolution Order (MRO).\n",

        "**19. Purpose of __str__ and __repr__ methods?**\n",
        "-  The __str__ method returns a readable string representation of an object for end-users, often used with print(). The __repr__ method returns a detailed and unambiguous string representation meant for developers, often used in debugging. If __str__ is not defined, Python uses __repr__ as a fallback.\n",

        "**20. Significance of super() function in Python?**\n",
        "-  The super() function is used to call methods from a parent or sibling class. It is commonly used in constructors to ensure that the initialization of parent classes is performed when working with inheritance. It helps maintain proper method resolution and avoids duplicating code from base classes.\n",

        "**21. Significance of __del__ method in Python?**\n",
        "-  The __del__ method is a destructor in Python that is called when an object is about to be deleted or garbage collected. It can be used to perform cleanup operations such as closing files or releasing resources. However, its use is generally discouraged unless necessary, as Pythonâ€™s garbage collector handles most cleanup.\n",

        "-  A static method is a method that does not access instance or class-level data and behaves like a regular function placed inside a class. It is marked with @staticmethod. A class method, marked with @classmethod, takes the class (cls) as its first argument and can access or modify class-level variables. Static methods are useful for utility functions, while class methods are used when behavior needs to affect the class itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "**23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?**\n",
        "-  In Python, polymorphism through inheritance allows objects of different classes that share a common superclass to be treated as instances of that superclass. When a method is called on the parent reference, the childâ€™s overridden method is executed if it exists, enabling dynamic behavior based on the objectâ€™s type.\n",

        "**25. What is the purpose of __call__ method?**\n",
        "-  The __call__ method allows an object to be called like a regular function. When defined in a class, calling an instance of that class executes the __call__ method. This is useful for cases where the object needs to behave like a function or where additional control over invocation is required."
